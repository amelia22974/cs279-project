The repository includes:

- Executable MATLAB files for:
      1. Puncta quantification
      2. Dendrite mapping

- imgs folder: contains 10 trial immunofluorescence image

- archive folder: miscellaneous files from our work up until the final output including Python scripts, past MATLAB scripts, etc.


Package Requirements in MATLAB:
- Image Processing Toolbox
