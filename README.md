# cs279-project

This folder contains work done by Amelia Woodward (SUNET ID: ameliawd) and Sid Dhawan (SUNET ID: sidsd27) for the CS279 Final Project.

Our project is titled: Automated Puncta Quantification and Neurite Mapping for Fluorescent Imaging in Neurons

The repository includes:

- Executable MATLAB files for:
      1. Puncta quantification with colocalization PCA
      2. Dendrite mapping
      3. Function for the colocalization scatterplot plot 

- imgs folder: contains 10 trial immunofluorescence images

- archive folder: miscellaneous files from our work up until the final output including Python scripts, past MATLAB scripts, etc.


Package Requirements in MATLAB:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Fiji with the MIJI plugin in order to corroborate the sholl analysis outputs. 
  Please note that we recommend the December 2015 version of Fiji and runnning the 
  macros in MATLAB. 

We also present a final report explaining the background of algorithms used and result. Please let us know if you have trouble 
running the scripts or generating outputs.
