# cs279-project

This folder contains work done by Amelia Woodward (SUNET ID: ameliawd) and Sid Dhawan (SUNET ID: sidsd27) for the CS279 Final Project.

Our project is titled: Automated Puncta Quantification and Neurite Mapping for Fluorescent Imaging in Neurons

The repository includes:

- Executable MATLAB files for:
      1. Puncta quantification with colocalization PCA
      2. Dendrite mapping

- imgs folder: contains 10 trial immunofluorescence images

- archive folder: miscellaneous files from our work up until the final output including Python scripts, past MATLAB scripts, etc.


Package Requirements in MATLAB:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Machine Learning Toolbox
- Fiji with the MIJI plugin 

We also present a final report explaining the background of algorithms used and result.
